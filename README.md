# SP23-Improving-Presence-In-Virtual-Reality

Our project's goal is to test how audio effects the presence someone can feel while in VR. We will be using an Oculus Quest headset to test this. The user will walk around a nature scene with varying levels of audio and then will be questioned based on the presence felt. The varying sounds will include footsteps, birds, and water/waterfall. The virtual enviroment consists of a path the user will be asked to follow surrounded by trees, mountains, and other natural pieces. 

# Instructions 

1. Install Unity and Unity Hub
