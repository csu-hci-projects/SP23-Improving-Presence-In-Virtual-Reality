# SP23-Improving-Presence-In-Virtual-Reality

Our project's goal is to test how audio effects the presence someone can feel while in VR. We will be using an Oculus Quest headset to test this. The user will walk around a nature scene with varying levels of audio and then will be questioned based on the presence felt. The varying sounds will include footsteps, birds, and water/waterfall. The virtual environment consists of a path the user will be asked to follow surrounded by trees, mountains, and other natural pieces.

## Instructions 

Here are the instructions used for our research on Improving Presence in Virtual Reality:

1. Provide the participant with the consent form and have them fill it out and return it to administrator
2. Ensure that they understand the intention of the study as they should have read it during the consent form
3. Have the participant put on the VR headset that is already setup to view the virtual environment
4. Ask the participant to virtually walk through the environment along the dirt part and look around at their surroundings. Remember that they 
  can turn a full 360 deg to look around in the environment. 
5. After letting them walk through the environment for 3 minutes, ask them to remove the headset.
6. Provide the participant with a laptop to complete the survey, making sure that they indiciate which trial they are completing. 
7. Repeat steps 3-6, two more times for the subsequent trials. 
8. After the participant has completed their three trials and three surveys, thank them for their participation and inform them that their trial
  is complete.
