abstract = {Context
Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a novel form of nonpharmacological analgesia therapy. We wished to review the use of VR to treat pain and anxiety in cancer-related medical procedures and chemotherapy.
Objectives
To determine if immersive VR influences pain and/or anxiety outcomes in patients with cancer undergoing medical interventions. To discuss critical limitations in the current evidence base and provide suggestions for future areas of research.
Methods
A systematic review was performed on Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, and Google Scholar from 1999 to December 2019. The following search terms were run in each of the databases: Virtual Reality and pain or anxiety. Articles were assessed by two independent authors for inclusion.
Results
From 999 retrieved citations, nine studies met inclusion criteria for review. Methodological limitations and small sample sizes preclude strong guidance for clinical applications. Although studies demonstrated a trend toward improvement in pain and anxiety, only two studies reached statistical significance.
Conclusion
There is inconclusive evidence on the significance of immersive VR in reducing pain (five studies) or anxiety (six studies) for patients with cancer undergoing medical interventions or receiving chemotherapy. Further research on the effect of immersive VR as a tool for medical procedures and/or patients with cancer undergoing treatment is required.}

    abstract = { Virtual Reality (VR) is starting to be used in psychological therapy around the world. However, a thorough understanding of the reason why VR is effective and what effect it has on the human psyche is still missing. Most research on this subject is related to the concept of presence. This paper gives an up-to-date overview of research in this diverse field. It starts with the most prevailing definitions and theories on presence, most of which attribute special roles for the mental process of attention and for mental models of the virtual space. A review of the phenomena thought to be effected by presence shows that there is still a strong need for research on this subject because little conclusive evidence exists regarding the relationship between presence and phenoma such as emotional responses to virtual stimuli. An investigation shows there has been substantial research for developing methods for measuring presence and research regarding factors that contribute to presence. Knowledge of these contributing factors can play a vital role in development of new VR applications, but key knowledge elements in this area are still missing. }

    abstract = "{The effectiveness of virtual environments (VEs) has often been linked to the sense of presence reported by users of those VEs. (Presence is defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions: the PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability;there is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs;individual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; andindividuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.}",

abstract = {Just as Freud used stages of psychosexual development to ground his model of psychoanalysis, it is possible to do the same with Erik Erikson's stages of development with regards to a model of psychodynamic psychotherapy. This paper proposes an eight-stage model of psychodynamic psychotherapy linked to Erik Erikson's eight stages of psychosocial development. Various suggestions are offered. One such suggestion is that as each of Erikson's developmental stages is triggered by a crisis, in therapy it is triggered by the client's search. The resolution of the search often leads to the development of another search, which implies that the therapy process comprises a series of searches. This idea of a series of searches and resolutions leads to the understanding that identity is developmental and therapy is a space in which a new sense of identity may emerge. The notion of hope is linked to Erikson's stage of Basic Trust and the proposed model of therapy views hope and trust as essential for the therapy process. Two clinical vignettes are offered to illustrate these ideas. Key Practitioner Message Psychotherapy can be approached as an eight-stage process and linked to Erikson's eight stages model of development. Psychotherapy may be viewed as a series of searches and thus as a developmental stage resolution process, which leads to the understanding that identity is ongoing throughout the life span.},

abstract = {From the seminal work of Yarbus [1967] on the relationship of eye movements to vision, scanpath analysis has been recognized as a window into the mind. Computationally, characterizing the scanpath, the sequential and spatial dependencies between eye positions, has been demanding. We sought a method that could extract scanpath trajectory information from raw eye movement data without assumptions defining fixations and regions of interest. We adapted a set of libraries that perform multidimensional clustering on geometric features derived from large volumes of spatiotemporal data to eye movement data in an approach we call GazeAppraise. To validate the capabilities of GazeAppraise for scanpath analysis, we collected eye tracking data from 41 participants while they completed four smooth pursuit tracking tasks. Unsupervised cluster analysis on the features revealed that 162 of 164 recorded scanpaths were categorized into one of four clusters and the remaining two scanpaths were not categorized (recall/sensitivity=98.8%). All of the categorized scanpaths were grouped only with other scanpaths elicited by the same task (precision=100%). GazeAppraise offers a unique approach to the categorization of scanpaths that may be particularly useful in dynamic environments and in visual search tasks requiring systematic search strategies.},

abstract = {Humans show a very robust ability to localize sounds in adverse conditions. Computational models of binaural sound localization and technical approaches of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation also show good performance, however, both their binaural feature extraction and the strategies for further analysis partly differ from what is currently known about the human auditory system. This study investigates auditory model based DOA estimation emphasizing known features and limitations of the auditory binaural processing such as (i) high temporal resolution, (ii) restricted frequency range to exploit temporal fine-structure, (iii) use of temporal envelope disparities, and (iv) a limited range to compensate for interaural time delay. DOA estimation performance was investigated for up to five concurrent speakers in free field and for up to three speakers in the presence of noise. The DOA errors in these conditions were always smaller than 5°. A condition with moving speakers was also tested and up to three moving speakers could be tracked simultaneously. Analysis of DOA performance as a function of the binaural temporal resolution showed that short time constants of about 5ms employed by the auditory model were crucial for robustness against concurrent sources.}

    abstract = "{The concept “presence”—often defined as the sensation of “being there”—has received increasing attention in the last decades. Out of the many domains of application, presence is particularly relevant in relation to Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR). Despite the growing attention in the concept presence, the influence of the auditory modality remains relatively unexplored, compared with its visual counterpart. This chapter provides an overview of past and current conceptualizations of presence and discusses how the auditory modality may influence presence within IVR. After an introduction to the comprehensive topic presence, the latest significant development within presence theory is introduced, Mel Slater’s conceptual framework for describing why individuals may respond realistically when exposed to IVR. With an outset in this conceptual framework, the remainder of the chapter is dedicated to illustrating how sound production and perception relate to the four constituents of the framework: immersion, illusions of place, illusions of plausibility, and virtual body ownership.}",

abstract = {Sound and virtual reality (VR) are two important output modalities for creating an immersive player experience (PX). While prior research suggests that sounds might contribute to a more immersive experience in games played on screens and mobile displays, there is not yet evidence of these effects of sound on PX in VR. To address this, we conducted a within-subjects experiment using a commercial horror-adventure game to study the effects of a VR and monitor-display version of the same game on PX. Subsequently, we explored, in a between-subjects study, the effects of audio dimensionality on PX in VR. Results indicate that audio has a more implicit influence on PX in VR because of the impact of the overall sensory experience and that audio dimensionality in VR may not be a significant factor contributing to PX. Based on our findings and observations, we provide five design guidelines for VR games.},

    abstract = { Background. Virtual reality can provide innovative gaming experiences for present and future game players. However, scientific knowledge is still limited about differences between player’s experience in video games played in immersive modalities and games played in non-immersive modalities (i.e., on a desktop display).Materials and method. Smash Hit was played by 24 young adults in immersive (virtual reality) and non-immersive (desktop) condition. Self-report questionnaires (VAS-A, VAS-HP, VAS-SP, SUS, SUS-II) and psycho-physiological measures (heart rate and skin conductance) were used to assess usability, emotional response and the reported sense of presence.Results. No statistical differences emerged between the immersive and the non-immersive condition regarding usability and performance scores. The general linear model for repeated measures conducted on VAS-A, VAS-HP, VAS-SP scores for the virtual reality condition supported the idea that playing in the immersive display modality was associated with higher self-reported happiness and surprise; analysis on SUS-II revealed that the perceived sense of presence was higher in the virtual reality conditionDiscussion and conclusion. The proposed study provides evidence that (a) playing a video game in virtual reality was not more difficult than playing through a desktop display; (b) players showed a more intense emotional response, as assessed by self-report questionnaires and with psycho-physiological indexes (heart rate and skin conductance), after playing in virtual reality versus after playing through the desktop display; (c) the perceived sense of presence was found to be greater in virtual reality as opposed to the non-immersive condition. }
